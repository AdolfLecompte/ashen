# Changelog

## 1.5.2

### Fixed
- **Installer resilience** — package install no longer aborts wholesale when a
  single package conflicts. `pacman -S` runs everything in one atomic
  transaction, so one bad target (a renamed package, an AUR `-git` variant, or
  a base package like PipeWire that CachyOS ships as a newer `-1.1` rebuild the
  plain repo would "downgrade") used to block every other package. Now the
  batch is tried first and, on failure, each package is installed individually
  so the good ones still land and only the genuine conflicts are skipped and
  reported.

## 1.5.1

### Fixed
- **Portability** — every path now resolves from `$HOME` at runtime instead of
  the hardcoded `/home/adolf`, and the install-time `sed` that rewrote the
  working tree is gone. `git pull` no longer dirties the tree or conflicts on
  each release, and paths that pointed at the repo checkout (glyph data,
  `general.lua`, `input.lua`) now use the stowed `~/.config` location, so they
  hold wherever the repo was cloned.

## 1.5.0

### Added
- **Audio device picker** — choose the output (speakers / headphones / HDMI)
  and input (microphone) from the volume panel and **Settings → System**, like
  Noctalia. Switching moves already-running streams, so it takes effect at once.
- **Cycle workspaces** with `SUPER + CTRL + ←/→` (next / previous, same
  monitor).
- Installer now adds the user to the `video` group so the webcam works out of
  the box.

### Changed
- The Bluetooth panel device list caps at 5 rows and scrolls past that instead
  of overflowing.

### Fixed
- Discord notifications now show the Discord icon instead of a generic Material
  glyph (icons resolve by app name when no `appIcon` is sent).
